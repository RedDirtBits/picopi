# Pico Pi

My adventures and experimentations with [Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) using [Micropython](https://micropython.org/).

# A Work In Progress

This is very much a work in progress.  Not terribly long ago I was spending good chunks of time using various Micropython based microcontrollers.  In fact, I have a cabinet full of them along with various sensors and peripherals.  I started out with Arduino but just couldn't bring myself to invest in and dive into the C like language after having spent the time I had with [Python](https://www.python.org/), thought I did try using the [Arduino Uno](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3?selectedStore=us) and the [Arduino Mega](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mega-2560-rev3?selectedStore=us).  I was very interested in PLC's at the time and the Arduino seemed well suited for such things.

When I learned that you could use _python_ on a microcontroller, I was off to the races.  I needed something that could keep me in touch with Python (I was not using it at work nearly as much as I hoped) and Micropython based microcontrollers gave me that outlet.  I don't live in a really technically saturated area like you would find in much larger towns and cities so I spend a lot of time working through the various difficulties and challenges.  Great for really embedding those lessons, not so much for staying motivated.  As such, the time spent working with microcontrollers comes and goes as I take breaks to not get overwhelmed.  That in addition to work/life balance, family, all the usual things come with much higher priorities.

All that said to say that what you find here is very much a work in progress and very likely not the best of anything in the way of coding practices, ways to tackle certain tasks, etc. but I am willing to listen to critique and if you have some to offer to help my learning progress, please, feel free to do so.
