# Raspberry Pi Pico Wirless

Though connecting over wirless with the Pico is as straight forward as most other [Micropython](https://micropython.org/) based boards (esp32, esp8266, etc.) it never hurts to have some examples to at least get started and then build upon that into improved ways that include such things such as logging, error handling, etc.
