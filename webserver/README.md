# Pico Web Server

You have your Pico on a breadboard or [Adafruit Swirly Mounting Grid](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5774) if you are using [Sparkfun Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) or [Adafruit Stemma/Stemma QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt) and you have wireless network connectivity, now what?

If your goal is simply to learn your way around the microcontroller and getting familiar with Micropython and primarily use console output then you are good to go.  However, if you want something a little more user friendly and perhaps a bit more accessible, then a web server is the way to go.
